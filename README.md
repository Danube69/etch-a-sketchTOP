# etch-a-sketchTOP
A hyper realistic almost 1:1 experience of calling back your hidden nostalgia by making an etch a sketch board online for you to play around with!!!!

This board can generate from 2 x 2 to 100 x 100 square sized boards with just a click of button and typing out your desired number in that range.

This was a very fun project to do even if it required a bit of reference from a tutorial it showed my resolve and determination to not give up even when times are hard. I also learned how to generate a grid in Javascript by using functions and for loops which helped in speeding up the process of the creation of that grid instead of copy and pasting a certain amount in say html.

I utilized the capabilites of using click events and manipulating them to work in tandem with the button tags in html so for example say I want to make it to where whenever I click the board my brush (mouse) turns on or off {true or false} I would simply make a few variables to make sure a click equals to true and then have that variable equal to false. 

There are a lot of things I have learned in this project that I am grateful to have the opportunity learning but we would be here all day if I explained them all!!!
